# KafkaClient
Kafka Client Subsystem in Java 

## Assigment Details
> Kafka queuing - v1.2

> As a mechanism to help us **understand how you approach problems, develop code, make tradeoffs, and communicate results**, we would like you to undertake the following exercise.   We appreciate that your time is valuable so we would like you to spend no more than 8 hours on it.   You may or may not complete everything you have in mind, but that is part of how we can understand how you would contribute in a real project.  The most important part of this is to have fun with it and use the opportunity to learn something new!

> For this project, at a high level, we would like you to create your own Apache Kafka (https://kafka.apache.org) client subsystem using Java or Python that receives stream of REST commands from one or more producers and then distributes them to one or more consumers based on criteria of application-specific complexity.   It is certainly a minimum requirement to get something working and demonstrable, but the choice of overall application concept, streamed REST data, consumer subscription criteria, and how to show us what is happening is up to you.

> Again, have some fun with this and let us know when you are ready for us to see what you have done.

## Breakdown of the assignment
- What do they want with the assignment? *They want me to understand how I approach problems* *Can I improve that before this exercise? Do I have the time?*
  - How you approach problems
  - Develop Code
  - Make tradeoffs
  - Communicate Results

- They want me to solve it within **8 hours**. What does that mean?
  - I need to be effective with my coding.
  - I need to have a plan. (*Note* Can I use the SCRUM training in any way? Task breakdown)

- Exercise assignment. What is it?
  -  It is to create a Apache Kafka. What is **Apache Kafka?**
